So I first took a video of myself walking around, then ran a python body tracking program on it to get the vertices of my body and make a frame-by-frame video of the positions of those vertices. This program plays an animation of those vertices walking around while a geometric transformation of it around the inside of a Poincare disk displays on the screen around the mouse location. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like.
